Multiple security-related improvements were built into the coding process and practices. Build-time tools detect buffer overruns and other potential security threats before the code is checked in to the final product. Of course, it is impossible to design against all unknown security threats. No system can guarantee complete security.

<span data-ttu-id="9e13c-p107">A Espionagem pode ocorrer quando um atacante ganha acesso ao caminho dos dados na rede e tem a habilidade para monitorar e ler o tráfego. Isso também é chamado de bisbilhotar ou falsificar. Se o tráfego está no texto plano, o atacante pode lê-lo quando o atacante ganha acesso ao caminho. Um exemplo é um ataque realizado no controle de um router no caminho dos dados.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9e13c-p107">Eavesdropping can occur when an attacker gains access to the data path in a network and has the ability to monitor and read the traffic. This is also called sniffing or snooping. If the traffic is in plain text, the attacker can read the traffic when the attacker gains access to the path. An example is an attack performed by controlling a router on the data path.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="9e13c-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked. TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. This does not prevent eavesdropping, but the attacker cannot read the traffic unless the encryption is broken.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9e13c-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked.

<span data-ttu-id="9e13c-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so.

<span data-ttu-id="9e13c-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. Using TLS prevents an attacker from performing IP address spoofing on a specific connection (for example, mutual TLS connections). But an attacker could still spoof the address of the DNS server that SfBO uses. However, because authentication in SfBO is performed with certificates, an attacker would not have a valid certificate required to spoof one of the parties in the communication.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9e13c-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic.

<span data-ttu-id="9e13c-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user. This can happen if an attacker can modify Active Directory Domain Services to add his or her server as a trusted server or modify Domain Name System (DNS) to get clients to connect through the attacker on their way to the server.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9e13c-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users.

<span data-ttu-id="9e13c-p114">Spim é uma mensagem instantânea comercial não solicitada ou pedidos de inscrição de presença. Embora não seja por si só um comprometimento da rede, é, no mínimo, irritante, pois pode reduzir a disponibilidade e a produção de recursos e levar a um comprometimento da rede. Um exemplo disso é quando os usuários fazem "spimming" uns para os outros, por meio de envios de solicitações. Os usuários podem bloquear uns aos outros para evitar isso, mas com a federação, se um ataque spim coordenado for estabelecido, isso poderá ser difícil de superar, a não ser que você desabilite a federação do parceiro.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9e13c-p114">Spim is unsolicited commercial instant messages or presence subscription requests. While not by itself a compromise of the network, it is annoying in the least, can reduce resource availability and production, and can possibly lead to a compromise of the network. An example of this is users spimming each other by sending requests. Users can block each other to prevent this, but with federation, if a coordinated spim attack is established, this can be difficult to overcome unless you disable federation for the partner.</span></span>

The Windows Server public key infrastructure (PKI) provides the infrastructure for establishing and validating this chain of trust. Certificates are digital IDs. They identify a server by name and specify its properties. To ensure that the information on a certificate is valid, the certificate must be issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by clients or other servers that connect to the server. If the server connects only with other clients and servers on a private network, the CA can be an enterprise CA. If the server interacts with entities outside the private network, a public CA might be required.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9e13c-p122">SfBO service relies on certificates for server authentication and to establish a chain of trust between clients and servers and among the different server roles.

<span data-ttu-id="9e13c-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect. On a TLS connection, the client requests a valid certificate from the server. To be valid, the certificate must have been issued by a CA that is also trusted by the client and the DNS name of the server must match the DNS name on the certificate. If the certificate is valid, the client uses the public key in the certificate to encrypt the symmetric encryption keys to be used for the communication, so only the original owner of the certificate can use its private key to decrypt the contents of the communication. The resulting connection is trusted and from that point is not challenged by other trusted servers or clients. Within this context, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as used with Web services can be associated as TLS-based.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9e13c-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect.

To access the A/V Edge service, the client must first have established an authenticated SIP signaling session with SfBO registrar to obtain A/V Edge service authentication credentials. These values are sent across the TLS-protected signaling channel and are computer generated to mitigate against dictionary attacks. Clients can then use these credentials for digest authentication with the A/V Edge service to allocate ports for use in a media session. An initial allocate request is sent from the client and responded with a 401 nonce/challenge message from the A/V Edge service.
